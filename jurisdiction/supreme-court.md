# ⚖ Supreme Court

The Supreme Court is the supreme judiciary power within the Nation3 jurisdiction.

It is composed of judges who are legal professionals, elected by the Nation3 DAO.

Its role is to resolve disputes by:

* Reading the agreement's terms.
* Reviewing any other evidence submitted by the parties of an agreement.
* Submitting a new fair financial outcome based on the law in effect and their judgement.
