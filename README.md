Nation3 is:

* Owned and managed by its citizens as a [DAO](https://blog.aragon.org/what-is-a-dao/) with [its own cryptocurrency](https://nation3.org/token).
* Creating the most reliable and efficient business environment for citizens to transact with each other online. For that purpose Nation3 is building a predictable system of law, enforced by a judicial court and powered by open source legal agreements.
* Issuing [digital passports](https://mirror.xyz/3.nation3.eth/zB-c7hjOVzKpBQCh0iq\_QVQlGgGv617NwyEFOQs5i8g) to citizens with financial skin-in-the-game and rewarding their contributions in public forums.
* Aiming to eventually acquire land across the globe and expand its services.&#x20;
