Nation3 is:

* Owned and managed by its citizens as a [DAO](https://blog.aragon.org/what-is-a-dao/) with its own cryptocurrency, called $NATION.
* Creating the most reliable and efficient business environment for citizens to transact with each other online. For that purpose Nation3 is building a predictable system of law, enforced by a judicial court and powered by open source legal agreements.
* Issuing [digital passports](citizenship/getting-a-passport.md) to citizens with financial skin-in-the-game and rewarding their contributions in public forums.
* Aiming to eventually acquire land across the globe and expand its services.&#x20;
