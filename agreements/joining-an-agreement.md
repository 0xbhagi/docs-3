# âž¡ Joining an agreement

To join an agreement, you'll first need to navigate to the specific agreement's page. This link should be shared by the agreement's creator or other parties.

Once you've reached the Agreement page, ensure you're connected with an eligible account to join. If you are, click on "Join the Agreement" and follow the instructions provided.

Remember, joining an agreement involves depositing the specified **collateral tokens**. Additionally, a **dispute deposit** in $NATION tokens will also be held in escrow. This deposit is only deducted if you end up initiating a dispute.
