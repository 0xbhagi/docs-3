# ðŸš© Disputing an agreement

If you believe a party in the agreement has breached its terms, you have the option to open a dispute. Here's how:

1. Navigate to the specific Agreement page.
2. Click on "Raise a Dispute" to start the process.

From here, the [Dispute Resolution Process ](https://linked.md/v?u=ipfs://bafybeifiehkdnx5yhyrengoim5dhjclhxba6yhske6rwbm7dcv527gk524/DisputeResolutionProcess.linked.md)will take place. Parties involved can submit their evidence, judges will deliberate and propose a settlement.

If a party disagrees with the proposed settlement, they can appeal to the Nation3 DAO. The DAO has the authority to either accept or reject this appeal.

* If the appeal is accepted, the judges will be required to propose a new settlement.
* If the appeal is rejected, the initially proposed settlement will be enforced.
