# ðŸš© Disputing an agreement (WIP)

If a pary in the agreement has breached its terms, any of the other parties can open a dispute.

The process is:

1. One of the parties goes to the agreement page, and clicks _Dispute_.
2. The parties submit evidence to defend their claims to the judges.
3. The judges review the evidence, deliberate and propose a settlement.
4. Any of the parties can appeal the proposed settlement to the Nation3 DAO, which can acceptÂ or reject the appeal.
   1. If the appeal is accepted, then the judges must review any new materials and submit a new settlement.
   2. If the appeal is rejected, the initial proposed outcome is enforced.
