# ‚úç Creating an agreement

To create a Nation3 agreement, you will need the following:

* The terms that the parties of the agreement will need to abide by. If you are familiar with Markdown, you will be delighted to know that legal agreements within the Nation3 jurisdiction are written with a very easy superset of Markdown: [linked-markdown.md](../linked-markdown.md "mention").
