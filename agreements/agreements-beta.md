### Understanding the Beta Phase

The Nation3 Legal System is a masterpiece in the making. As we consume our own product (a process known as 'dog-fooding'), we're refining our foundations, procedures, and user experience to deliver the most optimal solution.

* &#x20;📜 **Rules & procedures.** We're in the process of refining our rules and procedures. You can review the current rules under this section: [law.md](../legal-system/law.md "mention") section.
* ⛓️ **Smart Contracts.** Our codebase is only internally audited at the moment, and we expect to enhance them based on insights from the beta phase.
* 🏗️ **Key infrastructure.** We're still developing crucial infrastructure for better reliability and user experience, including file management, indexing, notifications, and more.
* 🌈 **User interface.** Our UI are continuously evolving, with new features and improvements being introduced almost every week.
