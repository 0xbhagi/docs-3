# 📝 Setting other wallet as signer

You can set another wallet as a signer, so you can use a different wallet to vote on governance proposals or authenticate yourself at in-person events.

The idea is that you leave your passport on a more secure wallet (like a hardware wallet), while being able to vote or attend events with a wallet on your phone.
