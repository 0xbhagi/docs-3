# ðŸ“² Downloading it on the phone

You can download your Nation3 passport to your iPhone (Android coming soon).

That way, you'll be able to get push notifications for governance votes and authenticate yourself in future in-person events.

You can click _Add to Apple Wallet_ to download the pass and add it to your Apple Wallet (Google Pay coming soon). You will then need to sign a message (there's no cost) to authenticate yourself.
