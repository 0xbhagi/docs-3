Right now, only Genesis Passports are available. There will only ever be 420 Genesis Passports.

To claim a Genesis Passport, you will need:

* A Web3 wallet. If you don't know what that is, [read more](https://learn.rainbow.me/understanding-web3).
* 2 $NATION tokens. If you don't have, [buy them here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/trade/ether/0x333A4823466879eeF910A04D473505da62142069).

Nation3 seeks to create a community of critical thinkers who care about the project. That's why some financial stake is required to enter.
